#Capabilties of JARVIS:

First, there are no commands to Jarvis. Converse with it, but try to make sure that the context you want it to act on is CLEAR.

Given a query/request/command, you can perform 7 types of tasks with Jarvis :

1) Close current tabs, e.g. "Close this tab", "Shut this down please" etc.
2) Close multiple tabs when you name their websites, e.g. " Close google and youtube "
3) Group tabs together by naming their websites "club youtube tabs please", "put together linkedin and udemy", "group google with medium " etc.
4) Reopen tabs given their specific context try to be as concise and accurate as possible.
   For e.g., "Reopen entertainment" , " reopen funny videos ". This feature accesses the last tabs you visited under 6 hours of time and finds the most similar tabs to your query.
5) Navigate on your current tab, in both directions and if you want specify the number of times you want to go back too. - "Can you go back twice", " Can you go forward 3 times?"
